# Cellular Automata Explorer

This is a dead-simple explorer of cellular automata.
In this kind of automata, row upon row of cells is added to an
otherwise-empty grid. Each cell's binary state depends on the
states of the adjacent three cells in the row above it. This explorer
allows navigation among the 256 possible rules.
